# weatherApp

A simpe weather application that displays basic weather information and graphics for the location that the user entered.

This is a full stack solution that includes a backend server created using Node with Express and a frontend webpage using html, css and vanilla javascript.

## How to use

The weather data is gathered using the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api). To use this API you need an API key, this has not been included in this repo for security reasons. To add an API key to the project create a file called apikey.js in the website folder and add the following line of code:

```
export const key = '';

```

Enter your own API key between the quotion marks.
